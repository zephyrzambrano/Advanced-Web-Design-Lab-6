<!--
*INSTRUCTIONS*
1. Create an HTML document to work with, that has a <div> with the id “wordsOfWisdom”.
2. Fill an Array full with Strings of random esoteric knowledge. (Keep it classy, guys.)
3. When the page loads, have one of those sayings placed into the wordsOfWisdom <div>.
4. Have a button below it that, when clicked, swaps in a new saying or refreshes the page.
5. Style the page so it looks nice! (Hit me with your best shot!)
